= Infusible

Automatically infuses dependencies within your object through the use of advanced dependency injection. Dependency injection -- the _D_ in _SOLID_ design -- is a powerful way to compose complex architectures from small objects which have a single responsibility -- the _S_ in _SOLID_ design.

This gem is inspired by the {dry-auto_inject_link} gem. There are a few major differences between this gem and the original Dry AutoInject gem which are:

* All injected dependencies are _private by default_ in order to not break encapsulation and a _major_ reason why this gem was created.
* Uses keyword arguments only while the original Dry AutoInject gem supports positionals or hash arguments in addition to keyword arguments.

The entire architecture centers on the injection of a _container_ of dependencies. A container can be any object that responds to the `#[]` message and pairs well with the {dry-container_link} gem but a primitive `Hash` works too. Here's a quick example of Infusible in action:

[source,ruby]
----
Import = Infusible.with({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})

class Demo
  include Import[:a, :b, :c]

  def to_s = "My injected dependencies are: #{a}, #{b}, and #{c}."
end

puts Demo.new  # My injected dependencies are: 1, 2, and 3.
----

By using _infusing_ dependencies into your object, you have the ability to define common dependencies that can be injected without having to do the manual setup normally required to define a constructor and set private instance variables.

== Requirements

. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].
. Knowledge of SOLID design principles.

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install infusible
----

Add the following to your Gemfile file:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "infusible"
----

== Usage

There is basic and advanced usage. We'll start with basic and work our to advanced usage.

=== Basic

This gem requires three steps for proper use:

. A container.
. An import constant.
. A class and/or multiple classes for dependencies to be injected into.

Let's walk through each staring by defining a container of dependencies.

==== Containers

A container provides a common object for which you can group related dependencies for injection and reuse. {dry-container_link} is recommended for defining your dependencies but a primitive `Hash` or any object which responds to the `#[]` message works too.

For documentation purposes, the {dry-container_link} gem will be used. The following creates a simple container where you might want to use the {http_link} gem to make HTTP requests and log information using Ruby's native logger.

[source,ruby]
----
require "http"
require "logger"

module Container
  extend Dry::Container::Mixin

  register(:http) { HTTP }
  register(:logger) { Logger.new STDOUT }
end
----

==== Injectors

Once your container is defined, you'll want to define the corresponding injector for reuse within your application. Defining an injector only requires two lines of code:

[source,ruby]
----
require "infusible"

Import = Infusible.with Container
----

==== Dependencies

With your container and import defined, you can inject your dependencies by including what you need:

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  include Import[:http, :logger]

  def call url
    http.get(url).status.then { |status| logger.info %(The status of "#{url}" is #{status}.) }
  end
end
----

Now when you ping a URL, you'll see the status of the server logged to console using all injected dependencies:

[source,ruby]
----
Pinger.new.call "https://duckduckgo.com"
# I, [2022-03-01T10:00:00.979741 #81819]  INFO -- : The status of "https://duckduckgo.com" is 200 OK.
----

=== Advanced

When injecting your dependencies you _must_ always define what dependencies you want to require. By default, none will be injected. The following will demonstrate multiple ways in which to manage the injection of your dependencies.

==== Keys

You can use symbols, strings, or a combination of both when defining which dependencies you want to inject. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  include Import[:http, "logger"]

  def call = puts "Using: #{http.inspect} and #{logger.inspect}."
end
----

==== Namespaces

To access namespaced dependencies within a container, you only need to provide the fully qualified path. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  include Import["primary.http", "primary.logger"]

  def call = puts "Using: #{http.inspect} and #{logger.inspect}."
end
----

The namespace (i.e. `primary.`) _and_ delimiter (i.e. `.`) will be removed so only `http` and `logger` are defined for use (as shown in the `#call` method). Only dots (i.e. `.`) are allowed as the delimiter between namespace and dependency.

==== Aliases

Should you want to rename your namespaced dependencies to something more appropriate for your class, use a hash. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  include Import[client: "primary.http"]

  def call = puts "Using: #{client.inspect}."
end
----

The aliased `"primary.http"` will be defined as `client` when imported (as shown in the `#call` method).

You can also mix names, namespaces, and aliases for injection as long as the aliases are defined last. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  include Import[:configuration, "primary.logger", client: :http]

  def call = puts "Using: #{configuration.inspect}, #{logger.inspect}, and #{client.inspect}."
end
----

==== Explicit Dependencies

Earlier, when demonstrating basic usage, all dependencies were injected by default:

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  include Import[:http, :logger]
end
----

...but we could have a different class -- like a downloader -- that only needs the HTTP client. In that case, we could import the _same_ container but only require the HTTP dependency. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Downloader
  include Import[:http]
end
----

This allows you to reuse your importer (i.e. `Import`) in as many situations as makes sense while improving performance.

==== Custom Initialization

Should you want to use injection in combination with your own initializer, you'll need to ensure the injected dependencies are passed upward. All you need to do is define the injected dependencies as your last argument and then pass them to `super`. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  include Import[:logger]

  def initialize(http: HTTP, **)
    super(**)
    @http = http
  end

  private

  attr_reader :http
end
----

The above will ensure the logger gets passed upwards for _infusion_ and is accessible to your class as an HTTP dependency.

==== Inheritance

When using inheritance or multiple inheritance, the child class' dependencies will take precedence over the parent's dependencies as long as the keys are the same. Consider the following:

[source,ruby]
----
class Parent
  def initialize logger: Logger.new(StringIO.new)
    @logger = logger
  end

  private

  attr_reader :logger
end

class Child < Parent
  include Import[:logger]
end
----

In the above situation, the child's logger will be the logger that is injected which overrides the default logger defined by the parent. This applies to multiple inheritance too. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
class Parent
  include GeneralImport[:logger]
end

class Child < Parent
  include Import[:logger]
end
----

Once again, the child's logger will take precedence over the what is provided by default by the parent. This also applies to multiple levels of inheritance or multiple inherited modules. Whichever is last, wins. Lastly, you can mix and match dependencies too:

[source,ruby]
----
class Parent
  include Import[:logger]
end

class Child < Parent
  include Import[:http]
end
----

With the above, the child class will have access to both the `logger` and `http` dependencies.

⚠️ Be careful when using parent dependencies within your child classes since they are _private by default_. Even though you can reach them, they might change, which can break your downstream dependencies and probably should be avoided or at least defined as `protected` by your parent objects in order to avoid breaking your parent/child relationship.

=== Tests

As you architect your implementation, you'll want to test your injected dependencies. You'll also want to stub, mock, or spy on them as well. Testing support is built-in for you by only needing to require the stub refinement as provided by this gem. For demonstration purposes, I'm going to assume you are using RSpec but you can adapt for whatever testing framework you are using.

Let's say you have the following implementation that combines both {dry-container_link} (or a primitve `Hash` would work too) and this gem:

[source,ruby]
----
# Our container with a single dependency.
module Container
  extend Dry::Container::Mixin

  register(:kernel) { Kernel }
end

# Our import which defines our container for potential injection.
Import = Infusible.with Container

# Our action class which injects our kernel dependency from our container.
class Action
  include Import[:kernel]

  def call = kernel.puts "This is a test."
end
----

With our implementation defined, we can test as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
# Required: You must require Dry Container and Infusible stubbing for testing purposes.
require "dry/container/stub"
require "infusible/stub"

RSpec.describe Action do
  # Required: You must refine Infusible to leverage stubbing of your dependencies.
  using Infusible::Stub

  subject(:action) { Action.new }

  let(:kernel) { class_spy Kernel }

  # Required: You must define what dependencies you want to stub and unstub before and after a test.
  before { Import.stub kernel: }
  after { Import.unstub :kernel }

  describe "#call" do
    it "prints message" do
      action.call
      expect(kernel).to have_received(:puts).with("This is a test.")
    end
  end
end
----

Notice that there is very little setup required to test the injected dependencies. You only need to use the refinement and define what you want stubbed in your `before` and `after` blocks. That's it!

While the above works great for a single spec, over time you'll want to reduce duplicated setup by using a shared context. Here's a rewrite of the above spec which significantly reduces duplication when needing to test multiple objects using the same dependencies:

[source,ruby]
----
# spec/support/shared_contexts/application_container.rb
require "dry/container/stub"
require "infusible/stub"

RSpec.shared_context "with application dependencies" do
  using Infusible::Stub

  let(:kernel) { class_spy Kernel }

  before { Import.stub kernel: }
  after { Import.unstub :kernel }
end
----

[source,ruby]
----
# spec/lib/action_spec.rb
RSpec.describe Action do
  subject(:action) { Action.new }

  include_context "with application dependencies"

  describe "#call" do
    it "prints message" do
      action.call
      expect(kernel).to have_received(:puts).with("This is a test.")
    end
  end
end
----

A shared context allows you to reuse it across multiple specs by including it as needed.

In both spec examples -- so far -- you'll notice only RSpec `before` and `after` blocks are used. You can use an `around` block too. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
around do |example|
  Import.stub_with kernel: FakeKernel do
    example.run
  end
end
----

⚠️ I mention `around` block support last because the caveat is that you can't use an `around` block with any RSpec test double since link:https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks/issues/1283[RSpec can't guarantee proper cleanup]. This is why the RSpec `before` and `after` blocks were used to guarantee proper setup and teardown. That said, you can use _fakes_ or any object you own which _isn't_ a RSpec test double but provides the Object API you need for testing purposes.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/infusible
cd infusible
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console

=== Architecture

This gem automates a lot of the boilerplate code you'd normally have to do manually by defining your constructor, initializer, and instance variables for you. Normally, when injecting dependencies, you'd do something like this (using the `Pinger` example provided earlier):

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  def initialize http: HTTP, logger: Logger.new(STDOUT)
    @http = http
    @logger = logger
  end

  def call url
    http.get(url).status.then { |status| logger.info %(The status of "#{url}" is #{status}.) }
  end

  private

  attr_reader :http, :logger
end
----

When you use this gem all of the construction, initialization, and setting of private instance variables is taken care of for you. So what you see above is identical to the following:

[source,ruby]
----
class Pinger
  include Import[:http, :logger]

  def call url
    http.get(url).status.then { |status| logger.info %(The status of "#{url}" is #{status}.) }
  end
end
----

Your constructor, initializer, and instance variables are all there. Only you don't have to write all of this yourself anymore. 🎉

=== Style Guide

When using this gem, along with a container like {dry-container_link}, make sure to adhere to the following guidelines:

* Use containers to group related dependencies that make logical sense for the namespace you are working in and avoid using containers as a junk drawer for throwing random objects in.
* Use containers that don't have a lot of registered dependencies. If you register too many dependencies, then that means your objects are too complex and need to be simplified further.
* Use the `Import` constant to define _what_ is possible to import much like you'd use a `Container` to define your dependencies. Defining what is importable improves performance and should be defined in separate files for improved fuzzy file finding.
* Use `**` to forward keyword arguments when defining an initializer which needs to pass injected dependencies upwards.
